# Hiring Landing Page – What I Learned

This project helped me understand and practice multiple core front-end development concepts.  
Here is everything I learned while building the responsive Hiring Landing Page.

## 🚀 1. Project Structure
- Learned how to organize a project using a clean folder structure.
- Separated styles into:
  - `style.css` → Desktop/primary styling
  - `responsive.css` → Mobile layout adjustments
- Learned how multiple CSS files are linked inside `index.html`.

## 🎨 2. Building Layouts with Flexbox & Grid
- Used **Flexbox** for sections like:
  - Navbar
  - About section
  - Team section
- Used **CSS Grid** for:
  - Job cards
  - Benefit cards
- Understood how these layouts adapt to different screen sizes.

## 📱 3. Creating a Fully Responsive Website

  @media (max-width: 768px) { ... }
